Ok so here we are, at the C# Language.
AIM:  Build a Vocal Training App the has voice input.

Aston Walker my good friend and Tech head business partner, has heard my ideas to create a vocal app for my personal project and stepped in with a hefty load of foresight for me. 

So Emma is Manning up to take on a new language to execute to the best of my ability an App that with process voice.

Last night we put our heads together and gathered the research to make the plan.

To Astons credit, he came up with the plan, Im along for the learning for sure.

THE PLAN
1- Voice Input
2- Process the voice & compare it against a database of scales.	\
	a- Input stored database in variable and buffer
	b- loop to compare against the db
	c- function/algorithm takes input and makes a comparison
